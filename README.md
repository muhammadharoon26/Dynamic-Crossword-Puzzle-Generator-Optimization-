# Dynamic Crossword Puzzle Generator (Optimization)

Problem Statement:

You are to create a Dynamic Crossword Puzzle Solver using Constraint Satisfaction Problem

(CSP) principles and Genetic Algorithms (GA).

Requirements:

1\. Use Backtracking Search and AC3 Algorithm to handle constraints efficiently.

2\. Use a Genetic Algorithm to optimize word placement and reduce conflicts.

3\. Ensure no word is repeated and overlapping constraints are satisfied.

4\. Add a mechanism for dynamic word suggestions (e.g., fetch words from a predefined

dictionary API).

Input:

1\. A crossword puzzle grid structure.

2\. A vocabulary file (list of possible words).

Output:

1\. A valid crossword grid.

2\. Steps taken by Backtracking and Genetic Algorithm.

Bonus:

Allow real-time editing of the puzzle constraints and dynamically adjust the solution.
